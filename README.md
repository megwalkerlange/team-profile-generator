## Description

This project is supposed to generate a selection of employee profiles based on information the user has put into the command line. It also uses test files to ensure the code in the constructor objects and methods are correct. Unfortunately, I was not able to finish this project in the time given but this has been a very useful project to get used to using test files, contrusctor objects, modular code and node. I feel much more confident in these areas then I did at the start of the project and intend to finish this when I can.
